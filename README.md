Data Structures Menu-Driven Program in C

This C program provides an interactive menu-driven interface to work with various fundamental data structures. Users can perform common operations on stacks, queues, deques, and linked lists through a simple console interface. It is designed as an educational tool for understanding and practicing basic data structures.

Features

The program supports the following data structures:

Stack

Push an element onto the stack.

Pop an element from the stack.

Display all elements in the stack.

Multiple Stack (Two stacks in a single array)

Push elements into Stack1 or Stack2.

Pop elements from Stack1 or Stack2.

Linear Queue

Enqueue (insert) an element.

Dequeue (delete) an element.

Display all elements in the queue.

Circular Queue

Enqueue (insert) an element.

Dequeue (delete) an element.

Display all elements in the queue.

Deque (Double-ended Queue)

Insert elements at the front or rear.

Delete elements from the front or rear.

Display all elements in the deque.

Linear Linked List

Insert a node at the end.

Delete a node from the front.

Display all nodes.

Circular Linked List

Insert a node at the beginning or end.

Delete a specific node by value.

Display all nodes.

Count total nodes.

Program Structure

The program is divided into separate sections for each data structure:

Stack operations

Multiple stack operations

Linear queue operations

Circular queue operations

Deque operations

Linear linked list operations

Circular linked list operations

Each section has:

Functions for insertion, deletion, and display.

Proper overflow and underflow handling.

The main() function provides a menu-driven interface, allowing users to select the data structure and operation they want to perform.
